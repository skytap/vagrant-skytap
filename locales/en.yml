        The instance never became "ready" in Skytap. The timeout currently
        set waiting for the instance to become ready is %{timeout} seconds.

          host_network_not_connectable: |-
            To connect to the guest machine using a network tunnel, the host
            VM must be connected to a network which is visible to other
            networks and has a NAT subnet. Please go to the network settings
            page for this VM and make these changes, then run `vagrant up` to
            try again. (Note: it may be necessary to power off this VM before
            making these changes.)
          guest_network_overlaps: |-
            The host and guest networks could not be connected via a network
            tunnel because the guest VM's network subnet (%{guest_subnet})
            overlaps with the host network subnet (%{host_subnet}). Please
            change the guest network's subnet, or enable NAT on the guest
            network's subnet, then run `vagrant up` to try again.
            The guest VM's environment URL is: %{environment_url}

          This Skytap environment (or the specified subset of VMs) can be
          accessed at the following URL: %{url}
          Note that anyone with this URL and password will have full control
          of the VMs until the published URL is deleted. (Finer-grained
          control is available through the Skytap UI.)
        already_exists: |-
          There is already a published URL for this Skytap environment.
          To modify the published URL, please delete it and create a new
          one. (Finer-grained control is available through the Skytap UI.)
        confirm_delete: |-
          This action will delete ALL published URLs for this Skytap
          environment, including those created through the Skytap UI.

        deleted: |-
          All published URLs for this Skytap environment (including those
          created through the Skytap UI) have been deleted. Users cannot
          manage these VMs, or access them through SmartClient, unless they
          have a Skytap user account with appropriate permissions.

        not_allowed_if_suspended: |-
          Suspended machines cannot be halted gracefully. Run `vagrant up`
          or `vagrant resume` to run the machine before halting. Alternately,
          you may power off the machine with `vagrant halt --force`, but
          data corruption may occur.
      suspend:
        only_allowed_if_running: |-
